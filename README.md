# Kickstarter-Analysis
## Overview of Project
Each year there are thousands of kickstarter campaigns to fund all kinds of different projects and accross different categories. Not all of these campaigns are successful in achieving their goals. Having access to data accross different campaigns give us the opportunity to analyze what makes a campaign successful.
In particular we want to help Louise make a data driven decision regarding her intention to start a kickstarter campaign to fund a theater play.
### Purpose
The purpose of this Analysis is to provide Louise with an analysis of kickstarter campaigns in relation to their launch dates and funding goals so she can compare it to her own campaing.
## Analysis and Challenges
There were  some challenges trying to analyze the data using certain formulas and applying filters at the same time as excel doesn't support this sometimes. Support from classmates and online searches helped find workarounds for this difficulties. Applying the excel formulas can be confusing sometimes but again the documentation and onlines searches help finding a solution. Working with a big dataset can be challenging as well, as not all the data can seem relevant at first and because you have to find ways to organize the data to make it relevant and be able to analyze it.

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
May is the month when more projects are launched followed by June and July. These three months also see the highest success rates which starts to decline as the year moves along. 
The number of canceled projects seems to be steady throughout the year with the exception of January that has a slightly higher number of cancelations. 
October seem to be the month with the highest number of failures where almost half of projects launched fail.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Projects with goals between $1000 to $4999 had a success rate between 73% and 76% which also has an inverse proportion with failed projects where we can find a failure rate between 24% and 27%. This indicates  that projects in these ranges are more lokely to succeed. There seems to be an inverse relationship between the percentage of failed projects and the percentage of successfl ones. One interesting finding by looking at this data is that projects with goals between $35000 and $44999 also had a success rate of 67% and a failure rate of 33%. 
Projects between $1000 to $4999 and $35000 to $44999 have a higher rate of success.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
It can be too big. In this case it contains data  about countries and other categories  that may not help in our analysis as they are not related to the specific field that we want to look at so all of this data has to be filtered. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a clustered column chart that displays the differences between mean goal, median goal, mean pledged and median pleded for successful and failed campaigns. 
We could also create a table that shows goals, amount pledged, outcome and average donation. Another table could show the outcome, the average donation and the number of backer for that campaign. Each of these tables could be accompanied by a either a line or a bar chart.
